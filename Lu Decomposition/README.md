#LU Decomposition w/ partial pivoting
##This algorithm is used to find the L, U, P, and A matrixes and x values for a system of equations
###This can be used on any system of equations, however remember to first solve for each of the unknowns and put them into LU Decomposition form.

Inputs:
* A = Matrix of constants
* b = Vertical matrix of solutions

Outputs:
* L matrix
* U matrix
* P matrix
* A matrix
* x values
