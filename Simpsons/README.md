#Simpson’s 1/3 Method
##This algorithm uses the Simpson’s 1/3 method to calculate the total amount of CO2  over a given time interval
### Things to note: If there are an odd number of data points, for the last interval trap rule will be used. Also this algorithm requires and equal number of data points in the x and y values. 

Inputs:
* x values
* y values

Output:
* Integral, or area under the curve of the data
