# False Position
## This is an algorithm fro the false position root finding method
### This algorithm had multiple inputs, but not all are required. Algorithm will automatically fill es and maxit.

Inputs:
* func = Name of function
* xl = Lower guess
* xu =  Upper guess
* es =  Desired Relative Error, not required
* maxit = Maximum allowable iterations, not required
* varargin = not required
